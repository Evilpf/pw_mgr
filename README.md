pw_mgr was created by evil. this is a simple application that can store strings in files and bring them back. It has a login system that is very inseure, but perfect for offline drives (i.e usb). Take the program with a grain of salt. 
It was more created to be used as a learning tool for myself then a deployable exe. Enjoy.
